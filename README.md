Read n and Calculate n + nnn + nnnn

Using Python, I am computing n + nnn + nnnn from a number n.

Problem Description

An algorithm computes n+nnn+nnnn for a number n.

Problem Solution

1. n is the variable that is used to store the value of an element.
2. Store the string in another variable after converting the integer into it.
3. Strings should be concatenated twice and stored in a second variable.
4. Assign the string to the third variable after adding it three times.
5. Ensure that the strings in the second and third variables are converted into integers.
6. Add up all the integer values.
7. Sum the values of the expressions.
8. Make your exit.

Program Explanation

1. Taking the value and storing it in a variable n is the first step.
2. Concatenating the value of n with the integer is done by converting it to a string.
3. After concatenation, the strings are divided into two variables.
4. After the string is converted to an integer, the sum is found.
5. A total value is then displayed for the expression.
